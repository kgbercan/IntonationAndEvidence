			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w1" id="w1">Week 1 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>During our first week, I mostly worked on administrative tasks to get our project going. I modified the website code from the 2015-2016 Simmons CREU group to fit our needs and project. I gave Emily and Sara a quick tutorial on how to make their own changes so they can upload their own weekly blogs and contribute to team blogs as needed. I also submitted paperwork to receive payment for my work.
			</p>

			<p>Additionally, I refreshed my memory on the Intonation and Evidence description. I downloaded <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">Praat</a>, software we will use through the course of our research to record, markup, analyze speech. I familiarized myself with <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-911-transcribing-prosodic-structure-of-spoken-utterances-with-tobi-january-iap-2006/">ToBI</a>, the speech markup tutorial we will be using, as well, and begun to explore <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> speech synthesis.
			</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w2" id="w2">Week 2 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I began the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-911-transcribing-prosodic-structure-of-spoken-utterances-with-tobi-january-iap-2006/">ToBI tutorial</a>, which will be used to mark-up samples of speech. I listened to examples and learned these terms and mark-up rules:
				<ul>
					<li>Tones
						<ul>
							<li>H*: high pitch accent</li>
							<li>L*: low pitch accent</li>
							<li>L-L%: low phrase accent, low boundary tone</li>
							<li>H-H%: high phrase accent, high boundary tone</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Break indices
						<ul>
							<li>0: word boundary erased</li>
							<li>1: typical inter-word disjuncture within a phrase</li>
							<li>4: end of an intonational phrase</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>I also examined the differences among sound waves of the following classes of phonemes:
				<ul>
					<li>vowels</li>
					<li>n, m, ng (sonorants)</li>
					<li>p, t, k, hard g, d b (stop consonants)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w3" id="w3">Week 3 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I worked through Chapter 2.4 on ToBI, and I started marking-up a radio news corpus. I realized I needed to do more practice with Praat and speech mark-up, so I tried some exercises on the ToBI tutorial page.</p>

			<p>I also received a file with results from a sample taken of recording of different words, said with various prosodic changes. This file will have a script run on it in the near future to clean it up and see if there's a relationship among various elements.
			</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w4" id="w4">Week 4 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I continued work on the ToBI tutorial and revisited marking-up an FM radio news paragraph reading to practice annotating. I paid close attention to concepts and examples that didn't make sense to me to get clarification from my team and advisor.
			</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w5" id="w5">Week 5 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I finished marking-up the FM radio news piece. After discussing it with my team, I realized I did about half of it correctly, and now I have more clarification on ToBI annotation rules to go back and clean-up my work.
			</p>

			<p>It is a challenge for me to annotate recordings. When I do the exercises on the ToBI tutorial, I know what specific boundary tones and pitch accents to look for, but when I'm working on a mixed piece, I can only rely on what I've learned in each chapter and try to identify exactly what I'm hearing without the guidance of a specific chapter topic.
			</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w6" id="w6">Week 6 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I started writing a script with Python to parse a .TextGrid file into a .CSV.</p>

			<p>.TextGrid is the text file behind the annotations we make on sound files in Praat. To compare each team member's annotations, we have to put it into a spreadsheet, but there is no easy way to do it. I wrote a program which reads one specified .TextGrid and successfully puts it in a spreadsheet.</p>

			<p>Some challenges I had this week included copying information from a text file efficiently; handling cases where one word has at least one pitch accent and at least one boundary tone; and the usual bugs we run into while programming.</p>

			<p>I still have to test my code on my teammates' .TextGrids to make sure it works for their annotations as well as mine, and I have to modify the code to create a new column for each person's mark-ups for easy comparison.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w7" id="w7">Week 7</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>The Python program I finished last week worked on Sara's and Emily's .TextGrids, so I expanded the code to take at least one argument (file name for a .TextGrid) and parse each file into a cohesive spreadsheet. The programs and descriptions can be found on my GitHub in my <a href="https://github.com/kgbercan/IAI-Scripts">IAI-Scripts repository</a>.</p>

			<p>To take arguments, I use <span class="code">from sys import argv</span>. For regular expressions <span class="code">import re</span>, and to write .CSV files <span class="code">import csv</span>.</p>

			<p>I create a TextGrid class which holds the name of the .TextGrid (the file name as a String) and a list for each tier in the .TextGrid--xmin, xmax, words, tones, breaks, and misc. Each <span class="code">TextGrid</span> created is stored in a list called <span class="code">tg</span>, though the very first item (index 0) is actually the script name.</p>

			<p>In main(), I create a 2-dimensional list, which begins with the first three column names--xmin, xmax, and words. I also create variables which hold regular expression patterns used to parse each .TextGrid.</p>

			<p>Then, we walk through each <span class="code">TextGrid</span> in the list tg, skipping the first item (recall: tg[0] holds the name of the script, not the name of a file). We open each file by accessing the <span class="code">TextGrid</span>'s name property and walk it line by line, using our predefined regular expressions as check-points and filters. When appropriate, we append specific bits of information to the <span class="code">TextGrid</span>'s list properties, like words and tones. Once the file has been copied into the lists, the function <span class="code">lineUpTiers(tier, xmax)</span> takes one of the lists and matches its mark-ups with the correct point in the sound file, using the first .TextGrid's word limits as the boundaries, so that each person's mark-ups align, when their word boundaries are fractions of a second off from each other's.</p>

			<p>Finally, once we have read and lined up each .TextGrid, we add it to the 2-dimensional list in the right order, so it's easy to compare all the tones from each .TextGrid, all the break from each .TextGrid, etc... And of course, the .CSV file is written to from this list at the very end.</p>

			<p>Remaining possible improvements include making <span class="code">lineUpTiers(tier,xmax)</span> a part of <span class="code">TextGrid</span> and adding functionality to pass in a folder in addition to an individual file.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w8" id="w">Week 8</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I focused on writing a script that calculates how many agreeing labels each labeler has on each word.</p>

			<p>The program takes one argument, a .csv made using the script I wrote last week called tgToCsv_v2.py. It walks through that file, calculating how many labelers there are based on the length of the spreadsheet, and it makes a copy of each person's tones column to compare.</p>

			<p>In the function agreements(), on every word, each person's labels are compared to the labels of every person after itself. For example, if we have four labelers, the first person's is compared with the second, third, and fourth people's labels; the second's is compared with the third and fourth's; and the third's is compared with the fourth's labels. For each matching label, a point is added to the row.</p>

			<p>In the first version of my program, I only compared existing labels. That is, if three people had only one label and the fourth person had two labels (a pitch accent and a boundary tone), there was no way to account for the difference in labels applied. They would just get a point for every match and the total possible points was simply the total possible matches given the submitted labels.</p>

			<p>In the second version, as recommended by my advisor, each person's label cell is given two spots, a pitch accent and a boundary tone. Now, I am able to compare only the first spot in each cell with the next people's first spots, and the second spot with the next second spots. In the case that someone only puts down one label, their other spot is blank and is still compared. A blank spot can match another blank spot and count as a match.</p>

			<p>More usage information and examples can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kgbercan/IAI-Scripts">GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w9" id="w9">Week 9</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I am shifting my focus to Festival, a speech synthesis system we hope to use to manipulate sound files. With Festival, our main goal is to adjust pitch accents on sound files to see if certain changes change the meaning of the phrases for participants.</p>

			<p>This week, I tried to get started with Festival on my own machine to set up an environment where we could manipulate our sound files. The manual on Festival's website seems to be out of date so I was unable to install it, so I will continue to look for a solution next week.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w10" id="w10">Week 10</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I am very close to installing Festival, having found some forums that pointed me in the right direction. I am writing down my steps as I go for Festival-hopefuls in the future, but since I have not successfully installed it yet, I will post it next week.</p>

			<p>I follow the Festival INSTALL files and the manual from the Festival website, but since those are out of date and convoluted for my purposes, it's been helpful to google my errors and see how others have been able to solve the same issues.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w11" id="w11">Week 11</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I looked for more solutions to install Fesitval, and I think I need to change my PATH in order to make it work. One of my classmates accidentally deleted her PATH variable trying to update it once, so I am seeking help from a professor in my department before moving forward.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w12" id="w12">Week 12</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I finally was able to install Fesitval! Here are the steps:</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/download.html">downloads</a> on Festival's website</li>
					<li>Make sure you meet the system requirements
						<ul>
							<li>I'm running on a Mac, which is a unix-like environment</li>
							<li>I have a C++ compiler, which I know because when I type <span class="code">gcc</span> into a terminal window, it does not output "command not found"</li>
							<li>But I still need GNU Make
								<ol>
									<li>Go <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">here</a> and scroll to the "Downloading Make" section</li>
									<li>Click on the main GNU FTP server and download the second to last file, version 4.2.</li>
									<li>Unpack this folder in your home directory **you can double click on the .tar.gz file to unpack it, but to make sure nothing goes wrong, I used command-line as walked through <a href="http://info.eps.surrey.ac.uk/FAQ/unpack.html">here</a>.</li>
									<li>Type the following into the command-line:
										<br>
										<span class="code">cd make-4.2/</span>
										<br>
										<span class="code">./configure</span>
										<br>
										<span class="code">make</span>
										<br>
										<span class="code">make install</span>
										<br><span class="code">make clean</span>
										<br>
										**these instructions and more detail on installing GNU Make can be found in text file INSTALL
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Go to the <a href="http://festvox.org/festival/">US Festival site</a> and click 'downloads' to be taken to an FTP index.
						<ol>
							<li>In your home directory, make a folder to hold all your Festival downloads. I called mine `fest.`</li>
							<li>Download the following from the index above, and move them into `fest`, but be careful not to unpack until the next step.
								<ul>
									<li>festival-2.4-release.tar.gz</li>
									<li>speech_tools-2.4-release.tar.gz</li>
									<li>festlex_CMU.tar.gz</li>
									<li>festlex_OALD.tar.gz</li>
									<li>festlex_POSLEX.tar.gz</li>
									<li>From the `voices` folder: festvox_kallpc16k.tar.gz and festvox_rablpc16k.tar.gz</li>
									<li>From <a href="http://festvox.org/download.html">festvox</a>: festvox-2.7.0-release.tar.gz</li>
									<li>The documentation says to download a festdoc file, too, but I can't find it so we'll skip it.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Unpack them all, using the method we used for GNU Make and <span class="important">making sure festival-2.4-release is done first</span>.</li>
							<li>Open speech_tools/INSTALL and follow what it says:
								<ol>
									<li>cd into speech_tools/ and type <span class="code">./configure</span>.</li>
									<li>Type the command <span class="code">gnumake</span>. This takes a long time. Also, the documentation says you may need to use <span class="code">gmake</span> if <span class="code">gnumake</span> doesn't work.</li>
									<li>Type the command <span class="code">gnumake test</span>. Again, you may need to use <span class="code">gmake test</span>. At the end of the output, you get "Test OK" if it was installed correctly.</li>
									<li>Add speech_tolls/bin to your path. I did not do this myself, but I watched a professor do it, and it seems simple to accomplish. If you are nervous about doing this on your own, seek help!!!</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>cd into festival/</li>
					<li>Type <span class="code">gnumake</span></li>
					<li>Type <span class="code">gnumake test</span></li>
					<li>This is the end! You should be able to run festival by typing <span class="code">src/main/festival</span> in this directory.</li>
				</ol>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w13" id="w13">Week 13</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>While not actually a meeting, this will be a summary of what was done over winter break.  We discussed the Tapia proposal that needs to be written for the upcoming month. Jazzmine will be the designated presenter as she will still be an undergrad during the time of the conference. We split up the proposal writing between the three of us. I will be writing the approach and results and contribution, as well as editing for overall flow and converting it to LaTex.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w14" id="w14">Week 14</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This was our first meeting since winter break. We finalized our Tapia porposal, Jazzmine taking lead on some of the writing as she will be the desginated presenter. I took the task of filling in gaps and making the whole proposal sound cohesive. I also put the proposal into IEEE format on LaTex.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w15" id="w15">Week 15</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>We discussed what materials and work needed to be delegated for our IRB proposal. I will be doing a user satisfaction survey and potentially some demographic questions. This is different than other surveys I have written before because it must be understandable to children in such a way that they will answer honestly.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w16" id="w16">Week 16</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>We narrowed down what needed to be worked on for the surveys as well as our final curriculum. This week I will be working on Scratch to make a project that teaches more about Python variables. </p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w17" id="w17">Week 17</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week we went over our survey drafts that we had prepared. Specifically we discussed whether or not I should prepare demographic questions and went over the wording/tone for my user satisfaction one. We are trying to finalize our IRB proposal to submit next week. I also demonstrated more of my Scratch project on Variable types, and we collaborated on what needed to be developed more for that.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w18" id="w18">Week 18</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This meeting we have realized that a lot of our contacts for possible testing groups have not been fruitful. With the realization that we may not be able to test our games, we have deicided to focus more on the development of some sort of sand box to hold them in, such as a website or Java gui file. I personally will be working on getting a website started and incorporating our games onto it. I think we learned a lot about the process of working with children; it's not as easy as it is with other test group subjects. Next time, we may have to approach this very differently. Instead of potentially getting a group to come to us, we may need to gather a group of children volunteers. Either way, we'll work on the best project demo that we can possibly make.</p>
			<br/>


			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w19" id="w19">Week 19</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I began working on the demo website. It's not much currently and will eventually be linked to on the main page once it's a little more substantial. We also began splittling up additional work for us to do over the next week, as we will be on spring break. This also mean no meeting next week either. </p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w20" id="w20">Week 20</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I had jury duty and was not able to make our usual meeting. I continued to work on the website and Jazzmine and Maria caught me up.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w21" id="w21">Week 21</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I am adding more instructions to the demo website as well as polishing off how the participants will use the website for testing, which will potentially begin next week. </p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w22" id="w22">Week 22</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>We submitted out proposal for the Undergraduate Symposium that Simmons holds. I am setting up our accounts PRePP to use the Simmons psych undergraduate population as our participants as well.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w23" id="w23">Week 23</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I focused on some finalizations of the website, as well as making it more user-friendly looks-wise. We did a demo of our procedure ourselves to see how it would work with participants, and made some changes based on that. I will continue tweaking the website until we test it with real participants.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w24" id="w24">Week 24</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>I sent my availibility to the doodle that Jazzmine had set-up to figure out when each of us could run testing on different days. We also got confirmed as panelists for the Undergraduate Symposium! I continued to modify the website based on the other's suggestions.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w25" id="w25">Week 25</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>Maria is away this week, Jazzmine and I are focused on getting participants. I reached out to my past Psych Profs. in order to have them mention our study in class. I also created a flyer for our study.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w26" id="w26">Week 26</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week was the UGS! I ran the analysis on all of our collected participant data. Not as big of an <i>n</i> as I would have liked (11 total participants), but this is to be expected as other studies may have already poached some of our possible participants. The panel went very well, with me explaining the analysis that I did. We may also have a possible future group to work with over the summer! I am excited to see how that pans out.</p>
