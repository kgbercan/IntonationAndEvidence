		<h3>Focus</h3><br>
		<p>Intonation and Evidence is an interdisciplinary research project in Computer Science and Linguistics which seeks to improve computers' speech understanding  by identifying appropriate prosody. In addition to expressing paralinguistic information, such as emotional state or gender, the prosody or intonational contour of an utterance contributes to communication in a variety of other ways. One such proposed function is conveying a speaker's certainty about the evidence for their own beliefs, as well as their assessment of what the listener believes. Through a series of production and perceptual experiments designed to capture human speech in context, the appropriate prosodic contour will be captured. These findings will then be used to augment automatic speech synthesis and the output will be tested for naturalness and ease of understanding.

		<h3>CREU at Simmons</h3><br/>
		<p>
			<a href="http://cra-w.org/creu">CREU</a> aims to provide research experience to undergraduates who are qualified computer scientists but may face discrimination in the CS field. A concurrent Simmons research project intends to identify and analyze the sucurity vulnerabilities and effectiveness of the Emotiv BCI. Past Simmons research projects through CREU have investigated pitch contours and how they influence speech perception; human gesture using a newly developed annotation method; an analysis of the way pitch contour is perceived; and an improved natural language interface for course registration.

		<h4>Website Design</h4>
		<p>This website was written and initially used by a former Simmons College CREU group, <a href="http://anita.simmons.edu/~creu/CREU2015/index.html">Teaching Coding Concepts through Gaming</a>. The Intonation and Evidence CREU team is grateful for their willingness to share their source code.
