			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w1" id="w1">Week 1 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This was our first week working on the Intonation and Evidence project. Our group tasks consisted of setting up our website. This week we also began exploring PRATT and the TOBI tutorial. As a group we discussed our goals and jobs for the project as well as looking at various sound files in PRATT.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w2" id="w2">Week 2 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>Throughout this week the main task was to work on the first portion of the TOBI tutorial. We were introduced to the structure and process of labeling sound files. This included the diffrences between tones, boundary tones and break indices. The first three chapters began an inventory for different types of tones and boundary tones including H*, L* tones and H-H% and L-L% as boundary tones.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w3" id="w3">Week 3 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I completed the ToBi tutorial to 2.4, where the boundary tones of L-H% and H-L% were introduced. Throughout this section of the tutorial examples were given of different patterns that could be heard. I found the activities that were given in this chapter to be helpful, in then sense that I was able to label them myself and then go through and check if my answers were the same as the tutorials.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w4" id="w4">Week 4 </a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I completed 2.5 &amp; 2.6 of the Tobi tutorial. This included the introduction of bi-tonal pitch accents as well as a downstep pitch accent. After first being exposed to these elements I had a little bit of difficult truly differentiating from other pitch accents, but after our group meeting today I feel that I have a better understanding of the concept.   In our team member meeting this week I found it helpful to put sound files on the projector and label together as we could talk through discrepancies that were presented.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w5" id="w5">Week 5 </a></h2>
		  	<br/>
		  	<p>This week my time mainly consisted of labelling the FM News Radio corpus. I found that labeling this was relatively straightforward in the sense that it was easy to distinguish the tone and pitch accents that the speaker presented. I found it very common that for H* pitch accents to be present. I also continued to work on reviewing the Tobi Tutorial.</p>

		  	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w6" id="w6">Week 6 </a></h2>
		  	<br/>
		  	<p>This week I finished working on labelling the FM news radio corpus. I am looking forward to discussing these labels with the rest of the group to make comparisons. My individual task this week consisted of reviewing the updated material on labelling. This extends the information in the Tobi tutorial. When I have completed learning this material, I will work on teaching this material to Emily and Karina. This week I enjoyed how we each had an individual task and will collaborate this week.</p>

		  	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w7" id="w7">Week 7</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week was for the most a continuation of the previous week. I am still working on learning the labels, to allow for me to begin labelling previous and future data sets. I am finding that these updated labels are fairly similar to the previous ones, however I need to continue practicing until I feel fully confident in them .</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w8" id="w">Week 8</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I made a chart that outlined the new labels. One of my concerns was that during labelling sometimes the pitch track shows something different than what I am hearing. This was something that I brought up in the group meeting and I feel a little more confident in how to approach this. In the group meeting we discussed what should be completed by the end of this semester in order for us to be on track to run the second data set.</p>

			<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w9" id="w9">Week 9</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This week I mainly focused on working on the experimental design and set-up as well as the IRB proposal. This needs to get approval in order to run the experiment at Simmons. We assigned different tasks and parts of the IRB to work on. I also formatted and set up the powerpoints with the new comics that will be used to run the experiment.</p>

			<br/>


			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w10" id="w10">Week 10</a></h2>
		   <br/>
		 	<p>Moving forward into this week it was mainly an extension of last week in terms of the IRB being the main priority. I also familiarized myself with the experimental design and set-up and how we previously collected and organized data when the experiment was run the last time..</p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w11" id="w11">Week 11</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This week I continued to help in finalizing the IRB document. Specifically, this week I added appendices into the IRB that showed how the labelling conventions that we use work, as well as an example of the comic strip that will be used in the experiment.</p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w12" id="w12">Week 12</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This was the week of out Thanksgiving break so we did not meet as a group. We are continuing to wait for our IRB approval. </p>
		 	<br/>
<!--

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w13" id="w13">Week 13</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>While not actually a meeting, this will be a summary of what was done over winter break.  We discussed the Tapia proposal that needs to be written for the upcoming month. Jazzmine will be the designated presenter as she will still be an undergrad during the time of the conference. We split up the proposal writing between the three of us. I will be writing the approach and results and contribution, as well as editing for overall flow and converting it to LaTex.</p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w14" id="w14">Week 14</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This was our first meeting since winter break. We finalized our Tapia porposal, Jazzmine taking lead on some of the writing as she will be the desginated presenter. I took the task of filling in gaps and making the whole proposal sound cohesive. I also put the proposal into IEEE format on LaTex.</p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w15" id="w15">Week 15</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>We discussed what materials and work needed to be delegated for our IRB proposal. I will be doing a user satisfaction survey and potentially some demographic questions. This is different than other surveys I have written before because it must be understandable to children in such a way that they will answer honestly.</p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w16" id="w16">Week 16</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>We narrowed down what needed to be worked on for the surveys as well as our final curriculum. This week I will be working on Scratch to make a project that teaches more about Python variables. </p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w17" id="w17">Week 17</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This week we went over our survey drafts that we had prepared. Specifically we discussed whether or not I should prepare	 demographic questions and went over the wording/tone for my user satisfaction one. We are trying to finalize our IRB proposal to submit next week. I also demonstrated more of my Scratch project on Variable types, and we collaborated on what needed to be developed more for that.</p>
		 	<br/>

		  	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w18" id="w18">Week 18</a></h2>
			<br/>
			<p>This meeting we have realized that a lot of our contacts for possible testing groups have not been fruitful. With the realization that we may not be able to test our games, we have deicided to focus more on the development of some sort of sand box to hold them in, such as a website or Java gui file. I personally will be working on getting a website started and incorporating our games onto it. I think we learned a lot about the process of working with children; it's not as easy as it is with other test group subjects. Next time, we may have to approach this very differently. Instead of potentially getting a group to come to us, we may need to gather a group of children volunteers. Either way, we'll work on the best project demo that we can possibly make.</p>
			<br/>


		  	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w19" id="w19">Week 19</a></h2>
		  	<br/>
		  	<p>This week I began working on the demo website. It's not much currently and will eventually be linked to on the main page once it's a little more substantial. We also began splittling up additional work for us to do over the next week, as we will be on spring break. This also mean no meeting next week either. </p>
		  	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w20" id="w20">Week 20</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This week I had jury duty and was not able to make our usual meeting. I continued to work on the website and Jazzmine and Maria caught me up.</p>
		 	<br/>

			<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w21" id="w21">Week 21</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This week I am adding more instructions to the demo website as well as polishing off how the participants will use the website for testing, which will potentially begin next week. </p>
		 	<br/>

		 	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w22" id="w22">Week 22</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>We submitted out proposal for the Undergraduate Symposium that Simmons holds. I am setting up our accounts PRePP to use the Simmons psych undergraduate population as our participants as well.</p>
		 	<br/>

		 	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w23" id="w23">Week 23</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This week I focused on some finalizations of the website, as well as making it more user-friendly looks-wise. We did a demo of our procedure ourselves to see how it would work with participants, and made some changes based on that. I will continue tweaking the website until we test it with real participants.</p>
		 	<br/>

		 	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w24" id="w24">Week 24</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>I sent my availibility to the doodle that Jazzmine had set-up to figure out when each of us could run testing on different days. We also got confirmed as panelists for the Undergraduate Symposium! I continued to modify the website based on the other's suggestions.</p>
		 	<br/>

		 	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w25" id="w25">Week 25</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>Maria is away this week, Jazzmine and I are focused on getting participants. I reached out to my past Psych Profs. in order to have them mention our study in class. I also created a flyer for our study.</p>
		 	<br/>

		 	<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w26" id="w26">Week 26</a></h2>
		 	<br/>
		 	<p>This week was the UGS! I ran the analysis on all of our collected participant data. Not as big of an <i>n</i> as I would have liked (11 total participants), but this is to be expected as other studies may have already poached some of our possible participants. The panel went very well, with me explaining the analysis that I did. We may also have a possible future group to work with over the summer! I am excited to see how that pans out.</p>
