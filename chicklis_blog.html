      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w1" id="w1">Week 1 </a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>The primary focus of this week has been becoming more familiar with the background of the project. 
	   So far, I have been reading existing research on pitch accents and prosodic notation, as well as 
	   learning the many facets of ToBI, a system of transcription, using <a href = "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-911-transcribing-prosodic-structure-of-spoken-utterances-with-tobi-january-iap-2006/"> an online lecture series </a> created by Dr. Veilleux and her collaborators. 
	   With Karina and Sara, I began to make recordings in Praat, the linguistic software that we'll be using for the duration of the project. 
	   I am very happy to already have meetings with my group members and with Dr. Veilleux planned out for the rest of the semester;
	   it's good to know that we'll be checking in together at least twice a week.</p>
	  <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w2" id="w2">Week 2 </a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>This week I made use of Praat to better understand how ToBI is used. I recorded myself reciting different phoneme classes 
	  (e.g.: saying the words "stop" and "rock" to demonstrate stop consonants) and noticed that sounds of the same class seemed 
	  to produce similar waveforms. I am feeling much more comfortable using ToBI now that I have advanced in the lessons and 
	  have actually begun applying the system to speech. However, I have found that it is more difficult to notate speech that is not my own 
	  because I am less aware of how the sound was produced. In the coming weeks I will continue training my ear to notice the inflections in others' speech.</p>
	  <br/>


      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w3" id="w3">Week 3 </a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>I was able to proceed this week with the ToBI lecture series through lesson 2.4. In addition,
	   Professor Veilleux also sent us a 30-second recording from the FM Radio News Corpus. The sound clip features
	    a female voice reporting the news in a distinct anchorperson's accent. Using my knowledge from the ToBI lessons, 
	    I have begun to mark up the pitch accents, phrases, and boundaries of this recording. I'm feeling more confident with ToBI, 
	    but I'm definitely looking forward to checking in with Professor Veilleux to see how well my mark up matches the sound.
	  </p>
	  <br/>


      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w4" id="w4">Week 4 </a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>This week I began to annotate a 30-second recording of journalist, editor, and voice coach Margo Melnicove giving a news report. 
	  Along with Sara and Karina, I have also progressed to lesson 2.6 of the ToBI lecture series. I feel like I have a better handle on the 
	  mark-up system, which, as Professor Veilleux reminded us, is a means to an end - the end being our ability to conduct our experiment. 
	  Soon we'll be marking up voice clips from a past experiment conducted by other Simmons students, which we will be replicating to look for 
	  patterns of prosody and their meaning in conversation.</p>
	  <br/>


      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w5" id="w5">Week 5 </a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>I continued with my ToBI analysis of the sound clip featuring Margo Melnicove, feeling a little more confident 
	  after talking with Dr. Veilleux the previous week. Since beginning this project I've begun to notice little nuances 
	  in others' speech that I never would have noticed before - from the way people emphasize words to the point where they take a 
	  breath in a spoken phrase. Looking forward to beginning my new individual assignment and getting a feel for linguistic discourse 
	  and how one approaches writing up research on the subject. 
	  </p>
	  <br/>
	  


      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w6" id="w6">Week 6 </a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p> This week I was able to begin my individual assignment, reading the 2008 paper 
	  “A Question of Commitment” by Dr. Christine Gunlogson. This paper examines the use of 
	  declarative sentences in American English and attempts to model the idea of “commitment”. 
	  In brief, a speaker may use both declarative statements and “declarative questions” to express 
	  commitment on their part, because they do not expect a response from the addressee (for example, 
	  on seeing someone tossing out a plate and utensils around noon, I might say, “You ate lunch already?” 
	  Though the statement takes the form of the question, I am already pretty sure that person ate lunch). 
	  This form is different than a usual question that requests information, placing the commitment on the 
	  addressee (“Did you eat lunch already?”). I will be reading a few more papers on similar subjects and 
	  collecting relevant background information that Karina, Sara, and I can apply to our own project. 
	  </p>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w7" id="w7">Week 7</a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>We discussed our goals from last week. Both Jazzmine and Maria are trying to contact others who could help us recruit a testing group. Since we only have five weeks left until winter break, we are trying to code something for next week. Our goals are to have a basic lesson in Scratch on variables coded by each of us. We will then compare the three games and select the best parts of each. We also will begin applying for the poster session at Tapia 2016.</p>
	  <br/>

    <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w8" id="w">Week 8</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This week we wen over our examples of variables in Scratch. We all decided that we each had naturally done different 'levels' of a game, and decided to combine the game maria made with mine as it would explain varaibles and then have kids work on an example. For next week we will be doing the same, but with the concept of if/else. Jazzmine and I will be working on the poster proposal for Tapia sometime this week as well.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w9" id="w9">Week 9</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>We went over out If/Else examples that we developed in Scratch. The poster proposal was pushed off until this upcoming winter break as the deadline has moved to next semester as well. As a group, we decided that coding in for the games was more time sensitive and relative.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w10" id="w10">Week 10</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This past weekend we held the Strong Women Strong Girls "IT/CS Coding" Class. We demoed a rough version of our Scratch "What is a Variable?" and "If/Else" games. I think we gathered a lot of experience from this event on how to handle children and how much they can handle. They were from 3rd to 6th grade. For the upcoming week we have decided to begin working on IRB forms and to get to our timeline goals for the month, which is primarily find a reliable pool of kids to test the games on in the Spring.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w11" id="w11">Week 11</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>No in person meeting this week due to sickness, but had an email chain instead. We discussed the future of our project for next semester and plan to discuss more next week.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w12" id="w12">Week 12</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>We discussed when our meeting times will be for next semester. We also plan on working on our Tapia proposal/poster over winter break as well as coding projects. We also need to figure out whether or not the IRB process is necessary for our project.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w13" id="w13">Week 13</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>While not actually a meeting, this will be a summary of what was done over winter break.  We discussed the Tapia proposal that needs to be written for the upcoming month. Jazzmine will be the designated presenter as she will still be an undergrad during the time of the conference. We split up the proposal writing between the three of us. I will be writing the approach and results and contribution, as well as editing for overall flow and converting it to LaTex.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w14" id="w14">Week 14</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This was our first meeting since winter break. We finalized our Tapia porposal, Jazzmine taking lead on some of the writing as she will be the desginated presenter. I took the task of filling in gaps and making the whole proposal sound cohesive. I also put the proposal into IEEE format on LaTex.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w15" id="w15">Week 15</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>We discussed what materials and work needed to be delegated for our IRB proposal. I will be doing a user satisfaction survey and potentially some demographic questions. This is different than other surveys I have written before because it must be understandable to children in such a way that they will answer honestly.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w16" id="w16">Week 16</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>We narrowed down what needed to be worked on for the surveys as well as our final curriculum. This week I will be working on Scratch to make a project that teaches more about Python variables. </p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w17" id="w17">Week 17</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This week we went over our survey drafts that we had prepared. Specifically we discussed whether or not I should prepare demographic questions and went over the wording/tone for my user satisfaction one. We are trying to finalize our IRB proposal to submit next week. I also demonstrated more of my Scratch project on Variable types, and we collaborated on what needed to be developed more for that.</p>
    <br/>

	  <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w18" id="w18">Week 18</a></h2>
	      <br/>
	      <p>This meeting we have realized that a lot of our contacts for possible testing groups have not been fruitful. With the realization that we may not be able to test our games, we have deicided to focus more on the development of some sort of sand box to hold them in, such as a website or Java gui file. I personally will be working on getting a website started and incorporating our games onto it. I think we learned a lot about the process of working with children; it's not as easy as it is with other test group subjects. Next time, we may have to approach this very differently. Instead of potentially getting a group to come to us, we may need to gather a group of children volunteers. Either way, we'll work on the best project demo that we can possibly make.</p>
	      <br/>


        <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w19" id="w19">Week 19</a></h2>
        <br/>
        <p>This week I began working on the demo website. It's not much currently and will eventually be linked to on the main page once it's a little more substantial. We also began splittling up additional work for us to do over the next week, as we will be on spring break. This also mean no meeting next week either. </p>
        <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w20" id="w20">Week 20</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This week I had jury duty and was not able to make our usual meeting. I continued to work on the website and Jazzmine and Maria caught me up.</p>
    <br/>

      <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w21" id="w21">Week 21</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This week I am adding more instructions to the demo website as well as polishing off how the participants will use the website for testing, which will potentially begin next week. </p>
    <br/>

    <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w22" id="w22">Week 22</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>We submitted out proposal for the Undergraduate Symposium that Simmons holds. I am setting up our accounts PRePP to use the Simmons psych undergraduate population as our participants as well.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w23" id="w23">Week 23</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This week I focused on some finalizations of the website, as well as making it more user-friendly looks-wise. We did a demo of our procedure ourselves to see how it would work with participants, and made some changes based on that. I will continue tweaking the website until we test it with real participants.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w24" id="w24">Week 24</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>I sent my availibility to the doodle that Jazzmine had set-up to figure out when each of us could run testing on different days. We also got confirmed as panelists for the Undergraduate Symposium! I continued to modify the website based on the other's suggestions.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w25" id="w25">Week 25</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Maria is away this week, Jazzmine and I are focused on getting participants. I reached out to my past Psych Profs. in order to have them mention our study in class. I also created a flyer for our study.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w26" id="w26">Week 26</a></h2>
    <br/>
    <p>This week was the UGS! I ran the analysis on all of our collected participant data. Not as big of an <i>n</i> as I would have liked (11 total participants), but this is to be expected as other studies may have already poached some of our possible participants. The panel went very well, with me explaining the analysis that I did. We may also have a possible future group to work with over the summer! I am excited to see how that pans out.</p>
