		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w1" id="w1">Week 1: 9/4/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>During our first week, we set-up weekly meeting times for (1) just the student researchers and (2) the student researchers and our advisor, Dr. Veilleux.</p>

		<p>We discussed an overview of the Intonation and Evidence project, including individual roles for the duration of the research and for the upcoming week. To keep track of our work and share personal progress with our team members, we decided to create a <a href="https://3.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> account, where we schedule our meetings, set reminders to write our updates, and track weekly tasks.</p>

		<br/>

		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w2" id="w2">Week 2: 9/11/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>This week, we reviewed our progress in learning ToBI together, having reached Lesson 2.3 in <a href = "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-911-transcribing-prosodic-structure-of-spoken-utterances-with-tobi-january-iap-2006/">the lecture series</a> created by Dr. Veilleux and her collaborators. We also began recording various phoneme sounds in Praat, including stop consonants and sonorants, and examined how the waveforms differ between each class of sound. With Dr. Veilleux, we learned how to slow down audio tracks in Praat to more easily notate files with ToBI pitch accents.
		</p>

		<br/>

		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w3" id="w3">Week 3: 9/18/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>Throughout this week we continued working on the ToBI tutorial. While working through the lectures in ToBi we are continuing to add tones and boundary tones to our inventory. In one of our group meetings we worked together in listening to various sound files and labeling them by both ear and by looking at the sound waves in PRATT.</p>

		<p>We are going to continue working on the ToBI tutorial as well as practicing labelling. This week we are going to continue moving forward with practicing labelling by using a sound file that contains an FM news radio cast.</p>

		<br/>

		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w4" id="w4">Week 4: 9/25/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>In our student meeting, we practiced labeling exercises from the ToBI tutorial. We talked about concepts and "solutions" to exercises that confused us, and we addressed those confusions during our team meeting with our advisor.</p>

		<br/>

		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w5" id="w5">Week 5: 10/2/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>This week, we received our individual assignments from Dr. Veilleux. Karina will begin writing a Python script that will analyze a dataset of ToBI labels, comparing text grids from different labellers to look for consistency and hone in on any discrepancies. Emily's assignment is to conduct additional research on prosody, with a focus on papers by semanticians Gunlogson and Northrup, and Sara will be studying new conventions of labelling in ToBI.
		</p>

		<br/>

		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w6" id="w6">Week 6: 10/9/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>During Week 6 all three team members continued to work more on our individualized tasks. Throughout the past weeks we focused on learning the Tobi tutorial in order to understand the major conventions of labeling speech. After both individual work on labeling as well as team meetings discussing these labels, we all have a greater understanding of the conventions. Karina’s task for this week was to begin working on a script for organizing labels. Emily’s task this week was going through the literature prosody Sara’s task consisted of going into more detail regarding the conventions of labeling. This is what we have been working on individually throughout the past two weeks. As we approach week 7 we will be reconvening as a group and discussing our individual tasks.</p>

		<br/>

		<h2><a class="unformlink" name="w7" id="w7">Week 7: 10/16/16</a></h2>
		<br/>
		<p>Since we worked on our own things this week, we just summarized our results and asked questions about our specific tasks to Nanette. We will continue working on our own next week.</p>
		<br/>


	  <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w8" id="w8">Week 8: 10/23/16</a></h2>
	  <br/>
	  <p>During this week as a group we met to discuss how our individual tasks were going and to discuss future project plans. Karina's script that was made to comapre labels is very helpful and very beneficial in the continuation of leanring these new labels. Looking forward regarding our future plans we are going to begin working out the details for running an experiment with new subjects. In order to do this we need to begin working on an IRB as well as working out the logistics and details of how the experiment will be run.
	  As a team we will begin these tasks as well as continuing our individual tasks. </p>
	  <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w9" id="w9">Week 9: 10/30/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week we began to establish the design of our experiment, as well as constructing
	 our IRB proposal for Simmons College. Additionally, all three of us continued to practice using ToBI labels.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w10" id="w10">Week 10: 11/6/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>Emily and Sara finished up the IRB proposal, and Karina continued to work on Festival.</p>

	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w11" id="w11">Week 11: 11/13/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week we submitted the IRB and we are waiting for approval. Moving forward we are going to finish the remaining details of the experiment.</p>

	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w12" id="w12">Week 12: 11/20/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This was the week of Thanksgiving Break, so we did not meet as a team.</p>

	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w13" id="w13">Week 13: 11/27/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>Karina gave her update on Festival, and we decided if there is too much overhead to use it, we may go back to using Praat to tinker with recorded speech. We also honed Emily's randomizer to be a bit more specific to use during our experiments. We expect the IRB to clear us for testing soon.</p>

	 <p>This week we also set meeting times for next semester and scheduled tentative experiment times for after winter break.</p>

	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w14" id="w14">Week 14: 12/4/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>Sara</p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w15" id="w15">Week 15: 12/11/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week was finals week, so we did not meet and instead focused on exams.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w16" id="w16">Week 16: 12/18/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week marked the start of winter break, so we won't be able to meet again in person until January.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w17" id="w17">Week 17: 12/25/16</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah!
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w18" id="w18">Week 18: 1/1/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>Happy New Year!
	 </p>
	 <br/>


	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w19" id="w19">Week 19: 1/8/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This was our last week of winter break. We're excited to get back to work on our project!
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w20" id="w20">Week 20: 1/15/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week we solidified our plans for our production experiment. We did a test run and worked out kinks before getting started on the real thing next week.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w21" id="w21">Week 21: 1/22/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This was our first week of official data collection and the process went well. During each time slot we always had two group members there to ensure that the process ran smoothly.
	 After listening through the recordings it seemed that the usability lab was a quiet and conducive space for the experiment. The equipment worked well and the system that we use as a group
	 for data collection seems to be working well. We had a total of eight participants and it seemed that the directions were clear and understood well. As a group we are looking forward to continuing
	 to recruit more participants to allow for a larger subject pool.</p>
	 <br/>


	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w22" id="w22">Week 22: 1/29/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>We continued running subjects this week, which went well. We have a good pool of data to analyze next week.</p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w23" id="w23">Week 23: 2/5/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>And now the sound editing begins! We'll be chopping up our Praat files from our experiment into separate sound files,
	 so that corresponding comic strip readings can be compared across participants. We've also begun preparing to recruit
	 for another round of experiments later this semester by working with psychology department here at Simmons, which has a great online platform for
	 student- and faculty-led studies.</p>
	 <br/>


	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w24" id="w24">Week 24: 2/12/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week was used for editing the Pratt files into small sections that can be easily analyzed. Between the three group members we all took one condition
	 and were responsible for all the participants in that specific section. In order to chop the files we will listen through the recordings and save each comic as a new
	 WAV file. We are also going to have an accompanying text grid with each recording to have the words that the participant said and any mistakes or non-experimental speech
	 that was said. After this process is completed we will be able to proceed in analyzing the speech.</p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w25" id="w25">Week 25: 2/19/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week after briefly looking through the data we noticed a trend that because the comics did not include punctuation that this could be effecting
	 how the participants uttered the phrases. Because there was no punctuation we believe that this may have increased the likelihood to say the comics as if it were a declarative sentence, which is an L-L% boundary tone.
	 In our group discussion we came to the conclusion that because texting is a very prevalent aspect of the participant's lives and commonly punctuation is not included, this could be a factor changing prosody. Moving forward we are going to label
	 the S1H2 and S2H2 utterances and see the what results we get from those labels.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w26" id="w26">Week 26: 2/26/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>We have begun to investigate the punctuation issue from last week, which means a return to ToBI labelling. Emily and Sara each labelled the H2 files (in which the hearer has direct evidence of what the speaker claims) for participant one, and then compared to check for consistency. Meanwhile, Karina worked on a prosody aligner to match sound files with text grids. </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w27" id="w27">Week 27: 3/5/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>We were on Spring Break this week!</p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w28" id="w28">Week 28: 3/12/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>Nanette was away this week at a conference, so we met without her. At our meeting, we mainly labeled a few of our subjects' .wav files with the help of Nanette's colleague's student Z.L. at Princeton University.</p>

	 <p>Z.L.'s role with us this week was helping us understand the more complex and more complete labeling conventions. Sara, Emily, and I (this is Karina, by the way!) are mostly familiar with the oiginal ToBI labeling system we practiced last fall, but we are moving towards MAE_ToBI+, which uses the original labels we know and love in addition to more precise conventions. The new labels included in MAE_ToBI+ allow us to describe more than simply low or high boundary tones (the intonation we apply at the end of phrases/sentences) because humans speak using more than high, low, semi-high, and semi-low intonation--often our intonation is more complex and mixed than even that. Z.L. worked with us over Skype, explaining what the new labels sound like and collaborating with us on labeling a few sound files from our recent experiments.</p>

	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w29" id="w29">Week 29: 3/19/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>In our weekly meeting, we found out that Z.L., our colleague from Princeton, ran an altered version of our study with new comics to account for the issue we found out about in <a href="#w25">week 25</a>. We need to run the aligner on that data and annotate it, in addition to all of the participants' data we got during our first round of experiments.</p>

	 <p>With this data annotated, we can compare our results and provide support for or against our new hypothesis that: <blockquote>When presented with a comic that doesn't use punctuation in its text, subjects' speech defaults to intonation that reflects a period (.), known as a low boundary tone, even when the context of the comic should sway them to use a high boundary tone.</blockquote></p>

	 <p>We want to meet with Z.L. on skype again to go over the new labels one more time, especially since he was very helpful last time. We also need to update our poster for the upcoming <a href="http://necwic.hosting.acm.org/">NECWIC conference in Portland (Friday, March 31)<a>, and we need to start thinking about running more subjects with the updated comics and the updated (more clear) instructions for the comics.</p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w30" id="w30">Week 30: 3/26/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>This week, we went all in to prepare for the NECWIC research conference!
	 Sara and Karina labelled the H2 files with help from ZL, who also contributed his own participant results
	 from a new, edited powerpoint. Emily analyzed their data in RStudio and designed the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tq3IsUEogJIV2AjwCyaQf1fCmmSqpe4ZMY3ilG9YY-o/edit?usp=sharing">final poster layout</a>.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w31" id="w31">Week 31: 4/2/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>After presenting the results at the NECWIC research conference we are moving forward this week with finalizing our plans for the next round of research subjects. In this upcoming section of participants we changed the comics so that the participants were aware that they were supposed to add whatever punctuation they felt was appropriate as well as the addition of thought bubbles to make the context of the comic more clear. We are recruiting participants throughout the psychology department for this round of subjects and this seems to be allowing for a lot more sign ups. Instead of using PRAAT to record the participants we will be using audacity.
	 </p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w32" id="w32">Week 32: 4/9/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>We ran experiments this week. We got many participants through the Psych department sign-up, so we hope for good results.</p>
	 <p>For the experiment, we set up a laptop with a fancy mic to get a good audio recording and we have the participants read specific text from comics. Our instructions are very clear to read the comic first and understand the context before speaking, because subjects have a tendency just to read the text and not pay attention to the rest of the comic.</p>
	 <p>The comics are very simple and include situations about a printer being broken and about it raining outside. There are three panels per comic, the last of which the participant is supposed to read out loud (it is written in red text so they remember to read that sentence). There are 36 sets of comics, randomly presented in the powerpoint which the subject controls at their own pace.</p>
	 <p>We will run subjects next week, as well.</p>
	 <br/>

	 <h2><a class="unformlink" name="w33" id="w33">Week 33: 4/16/17</a></h2>
	 <br/>
	 <p>We did not meet with our advisor because our meeting day, Monday, was the Boston Marathon, which is a big deal for us in Boston--so much so that Simmons closes on Marathon Monday!</p>
	 <p>We continued running subjects and tried to begin preparing the audio files from last week for labeling, as we remember how long it took after the first round of experiments.</p>
